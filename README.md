# Word-Analyzer

So this app is an app where user enter a string of word and the app will count the vowels, consonants, and the length of the input.

HOW IT WORKS?

1. User enter a string of word(s)
2. Hit button ANALYZE and it will trigger the function Analyze
3. Inside the function, we use String.split() to split the string into an array of char
4. Then we use loop to identify each of the char
5. Then we compare the char with the declared char to identify as vowel or consonent
6. Then it will update the value for every loop
7. We use Array.length to identify the length of string
